# Better Flexbox Grid ü¶Å
By [@mpalau](https://twitter.com/mpalau)
Inspired by [Flexbox](http://flexboxgrid.com/) Grid but using Sass for beauty.

Using gulp for the compilation so please do

```
npm install
```
Also since we are using [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) if you want to compile changes just run

```
gulp sass
```

Or simply
```
gulp
```
To auto-compile everything on changes.

## Pending Stuff
Maybe more mobile first?
Thinking flex-direction row first and after a media query become row??

Please help üê∂
